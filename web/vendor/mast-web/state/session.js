// state/session — observable store for the current backend session.
//
// Holds everything about the currently-connected session that's
// downstream of what the attach protocol tells us:
//   - capabilities frame (v1.4.0 shape: features, slash_commands,
//     agent, caller_id)
//   - status (model, provider, turn state, context pct, perm mode)
//   - pause gate (v1.5.0): paused / since / reason / interrupted
//   - usage totals + per-model breakdown + last-turn cost with cache
//     attribution
//   - sessions list (from GET /sessions; includes idle/active status)
//   - cost-ceiling banner state
//   - inbox coalesce state (queued/dequeued per prompt_id)
//   - current session id + model
//   - server-advertised slash commands
//
// Initial value matches what app.js used to hold in `latest` + a few
// other module-scope vars.
//
// ─── One store per session, not one store ──────────────────────────
//
// This was a singleton through v0.3.0, which was the right shape for a
// shell with one session on screen and the wrong shape for a room with
// four. `createSession()` is the factory, and it is the only export:
// the shared `MastState.session` instance existed for app.js, which
// predated the factory, and went with it in #61. Each terminal in
// spatial.html / solo.html holds its own.
//
// That is what makes per-terminal state observable from outside the
// terminal — the thing a real status bar, cross-session unread, and a
// fleet view all need and none of them could have while this state
// lived in a closure.
