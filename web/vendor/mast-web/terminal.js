// MastTerminal — a self-contained, multi-instantiable mast terminal.
//
// The classic shell — index.html and its app.js, deleted in #61 — was a
// singleton: one AttachClient, one #output-area, one prompt, one status
// bar, all reached through module-scope constants. That's the right
// shape for a single-session SPA and the wrong shape for a workspace
// where four sessions are on screen at once.
//
// This is the same terminal with the singleton assumption removed.
// Every renderer that resolved against a module-scope `outputArea`
// resolves here against a per-instance element, and every piece of turn
// state lives with the instance instead of at module scope.
//
// Where that state lives, as of v0.4: session identity and per-session
// totals go in a state/session.js instance, connection and turn state
// in a state/connection.js one. Both used to be singletons and both
// are factories now, so a terminal holds a private pair rather than a
// hand-rolled `st` literal. What stays in the closure is only what
// nothing outside the transcript could use — DOM handles, half-drawn
// rows, the pending tool-call map.
//
// The payoff is api.subscribe(): a status bar, a tab strip or a radar
// blip can watch a terminal it doesn't own, instead of the shell
// polling term.state on a timer.
//
// What's here today: streaming markdown, tool-call rows with
// click-to-expand results, turn footers, the thinking indicator,
// interrupt, inline permission prompts, server-dispatched slash
// commands, grounded-source strips, observer-mode rendering of
// externally-driven turns, the hold — banner, controls, and steer
// (v1.5.0 §2.8) — and the client-side built-in slash commands: /help,
// /clear, /export, /tools, /mcp, /subagents, /perms, /specialists,
// /sessions, /guardrails, /pause, /continue, /abandon, /share, /model,
// /usage, /whoami — each gated on what the backend says it can serve.
//
// The commands that act on the window rather than on a session —
// /theme, /layout, /attach, /batch, /shortcuts — are not here, and are
// not missing either: a shell passes them in as `commands` and they
// join the same table, so /help lists them and the gate covers them
// without this file knowing what a theme is. web/shell.js is where
// both surviving shells get theirs.
//
// Genuinely not this file's job, because they belong to the shell
// around the terminals rather than to any one of them: the sidebar
// (including session delete) and the shortcuts / palette / picker
// modals. shell.js and spatial.js own those, the same way app.js did
// for the classic shell.
//
// With PR 3b that closes the parity list app.js had over a panel
// terminal. The target was never "most of it": a terminal in a panel
// should not be a lesser terminal than one in a tab, and where a
// feature needed a different presentation to fit the panel, that was a
// design problem to solve rather than a reason to drop it.
//
// Requires (load order): marked + marked-highlight + highlight.js from
// web/vendor/ — the CSP on spatial.html has no CDN in script-src — then
// attach-core/{errors,protocol,replay,client}.js.
//

    // reads — and it is forced by the two facts the route carries:
    //
    //   1. The ACL is session-scoped, and the sidebar's client is not.
    //      One AttachClient per DAEMON does the listing; the session id
    //      belongs to the panel.
    //   2. The gate is the negotiated protocol version, and the version
    //      only exists in a `capabilities` frame — core-agent stamps
    //      X-Attach-Protocol-Version on /events and on nothing else
    //      (pkg/attach/protocol.go:95, the only caller). A sidebar row
    //      for a session nobody has opened has never seen one.
    //
    // So the sidebar would have to guess on both counts, and the plan
    // is explicit that guessing here means feature-detecting on a 404,
    // which for this route cannot be done: denial and "no such route"
    // are the same status by design. A panel has a bound session and a
    // negotiated version, so the gate is a fact rather than a guess.
    // One gesture, listed once, in both shells' palettes.

    // The ownership rule falls out rather than being enforced twice:
    // both verbs are ActionSessionAdmin, so a session you do not own
    // 404s, and with the version already known that 404 has exactly one
    // remaining meaning — which is what the miss below says.

    // Viewer and contributor stay different words, here and on the
