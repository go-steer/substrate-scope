// spatial-audio.js — the room's voice.
//
// Five cues, all synthesized: an oscillator and a gain envelope each, no
// sample files. That is a few hundred bytes of code against a few
// hundred kilobytes of audio, it needs no CDN and no build step, and
// retuning the room's mood is a matter of changing two numbers rather
// than re-recording anything.
//
// Every cue is a *shape* rather than a note. A rising interval reads as
// arriving and a falling one as leaving without anybody being told which
// is which, and that is the whole reason these are worth having: they
// report fleet events to the half of your attention that is not reading
// a transcript.
//
// Off by default, and persisted. Sound on a web page is an imposition
// until it has been asked for, and a fleet console is exactly the kind
// of thing that ends up on a shared desk.
//
// Loaded by spatial.html only — the room is the thing with a soundtrack
// — and spatial.js treats it as optional.
